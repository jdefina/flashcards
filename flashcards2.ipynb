The document also highlights the regions where most of the fighting was concentrated after 1863, and the devastating impact of the war on both sides. The Union costs of the war were $6.1 billion with an inflation rate of 80 percent, while the Confederate costs were $2 billion with an inflation rate of 9,000 percent. Many southern farms, factories, and railroads were destroyed, and the southern industry was crippled. The Confederate states lost two-thirds of their wealth. The death toll from the Civil War was staggering, with over half a million soldiers killed and more than 500,000 wounded. \\n\\nImportant terms derived from this reading include:\\n- Civil War\\n- Confederacy\\n- Union troops\\n- Gettysburg\\n- Petersburg\\n- Atlanta\\n- Appomattox Court House\\n- Defensive war\\n- Surrender\\n- Union costs\\n- Confederate costs\\n- Inflation\\n- Southern farms, factories, and railroads\\n- Southern industry\\n- Death toll'"
